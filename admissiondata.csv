Don't decide really late because that's one major mistake I made. 
And also don't choose unis randomly cuz someone says its good, do your own research, depending on your major and your economic factor. For eg, For a CS major its useless to choose unis such as WashU cuz they aren't that great for CS, even though they might be reputed, so go by your major and efc. 
Focus on getting good grades and try to maintain a good academic record. And try getting a high SAT score in the range of 1450-1600 for maximum scholarships, or go test optional."
